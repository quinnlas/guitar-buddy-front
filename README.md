# guitar-buddy-front

The front end of Guitar Buddy, a web app that analyzes text tabs. The tool will read the text tab and interpret the rhythm and notes in the tab. Then it can use that to create a tab file, suggest an alternative tab, and more. Currently, it just gives the option to play the tab back through your browser.
